**Preserving the Spirit of Kashmir**

To **protect, promote, preserve and revitalize the Koshur ethnic and socio-cultural heritage**, safeguarding the voices, traditions, and knowledge systems that define the Kashmiri identity.

Kasperia exists to ensure that the stories, art, languages, and ways of life that shaped the valley endure,not as memories, but as living legacies.

## Objectives
- **Cultural Preservation:** Digitally archive Kashmiri manuscripts, art, oral histories, music, and literature.
